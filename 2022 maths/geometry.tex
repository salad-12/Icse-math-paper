 \begin{enumerate}
	 \item A lighthouse is $80 m$ high. The angle of elevation of its top from a point $80 m$ away from its foot along the same horizontal line is:
		 \begin{enumerate}
			 \item $60^{\circ}$
			 \item $45^{\circ}$
			 \item $30^{\circ}$
			 \item $90^{\circ}$
		 \end{enumerate}
	 \item Two lamp posts $AB$ and $CD$ each of height $100 m$ are on either side of the road. $P$ is a point on the road between the two lamp posts. The angle of elevation of the top of the lamp posts from te point $P$ are $60^{\circ}$ and $40^{\circ}$. Finf the distances $PB$ and $CD$.
